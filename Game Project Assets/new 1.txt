to do with question cards:

set them to be called based on index (0,1,2,3,etc.) with around certain points basically a variable will match such as correctQuestionsAnswered = 4, it will load a special question from a non indexed list, 

(please ask teacher if it is code callable, and not through the whole asset inspector thing)

maybe like


if correctAnswered = 4
{
	(load question [question name])
	
}

then maybe go back to ones from a different index so like have multiple question indexes:

multiple choice
true/false
yes/no

and have buttons change based on those facts, so abcd would be generic 4 buttons, true false would have their own, same with yes and no.
